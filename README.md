# How to process open transit data to empower urban mobility ? 

This project aims at understanding and implementing the data processing cycle behind transit applications, and identifying its benefits on urban mobility. To do so, we first focus on the transport data revolution and how Open Data is contributing to it.  We then dive into the top technical features of transportation applications through case studies, showing how it foments the rise of the so-called Intelligent Mobility in today's city life.

Finally, we develop a transit web-application, BergerAPP,  using publicly available transit data from a small French town where such a mobility service is not available . The city picked is Bergerac, the second most populated subprefecture in Dordogne (a department in Southwestern France), having a daily active public transport system. We thus highlight how open transit data can be processed and leveraged to help Bergerac's citizens and tourists navigate the city. 
 
 From development to deployment, the technical project of this paper demonstrates that it is possible to build a simple urban trip planner by using open-source technologies and open data.
